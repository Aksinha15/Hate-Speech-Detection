# Hate Speech Detection

This project is focused on detecting hate speech using machine learning techniques. Below is a brief description of the files included in this repository.

## Files

1. **Hate_Speech_Detection.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for detecting hate speech. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

2. **train.csv.zip**: This file is a zipped CSV containing the training data used in the notebook. It needs to be extracted before use.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and extract the `train.csv.zip` file to access the dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant Python libraries as used in the notebook (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Usage

Open the `Hate_Speech_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to run the analysis.
